Q15408072,Murray Hall (politician),"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">
</p>

<p><b>Murray H. Hall</b> (1841 − January 16, 1901) was a New York City bail bondsman and Tammany Hall politician who became famous on his death in 1901 when it was revealed that he was a biological female.
</p><p>He was born in Govan, Scotland under the name ""Mary Anderson"" and with the assigned gender of ""female"". At 16, he began wearing male attire and using the name ""John Anderson"". Hall reportedly migrated to America after being reported to the police by his first wife and lived as a man for nearly 25 years, able to vote and to work as a politician at a time when women were denied such rights. He also ran a commercial ""intelligence office."" At the time of his death, he resided with his second wife and their adopted daughter. His biological sex had been a secret even to his own daughter and friends, who continued to respect his expression after death. After his death, an aide to a state senator remarked ""If he was a woman he ought to have been born a man, for he lived and looked like one.""
</p><p>His last home was an apartment in Greenwich Village, half a block north of the Jefferson Market Courthouse (now the Jefferson Market Library). The building was renumbered in 1929, when Manhattan's  Sixth Avenue was extended south, and is now 453 6th Avenue. The NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project lists the building.
</p><p>Hall died from breast cancer, treatment for which he seemed to have delayed for fear of exposing his biological sex. He was buried in women's clothes in an unmarked grave in Mount Olivet Cemetery.

</p><p>The decision of the State of Connecticut to allow Yearwood to compete on the women's team is a focus of debate surrounding Title IX and trans people. In 2018, writing on the subject of transgender people in sports, ESPN called Yearwood and a handful of other transgender athletes ""focal points in a fight over the future of sports"". Yearwood has competed without hormones or puberty blockers, which, according to Vice Media, ""could have contributed to an advantage"". However, Vice Media also stated that schools requiring medical treatment for transgender athletes would create a barrier to entry due to the costs of treatment. In June 2018, in the state of Connecticut, there was a petition created by parents of student-athletes that had the goal of banning transgender girls from competing in girls' sports. This petition allowed Yearwood to speak on <i>Good Morning America</i> and address the issues that came with the petition and encourage other transgender girls to compete. The families of three students who have competed against Yearwood filed a lawsuit in an attempt to bar transgender athletes from competing in women's teams in Connecticut; the families are represented by the conservative nonprofit organization, Alliance Defending Freedom. The lawsuit was dismissed in April 2021 by the district court as moot.
</p><p>In 2019, Andraya Yearwood appeared in <i>Changing The Game</i>, a documentary that highlights the stories of three transgender athletes and the hardships they faced in the athletic industry being a transgender person. In the documentary, Yearwood talks about her journey of becoming her true, authentic self through all the struggles she faced growing up.
</p><p>In 2021, the Biden Administration withdrew former Attorney General William Barr’s support of the exclusion of Yearwood, reconsidering her right as a woman and her right to play women's sports.
</p><p>Yearwood received recruitment interest from Harvard University, the University of Connecticut, Springfield College, and West Point to run track and field in the NCAA. As of 2021, she was a student at North Carolina Central University.

Rogers developed a technically highly proficient ventriloquism act with her ventriloquist figure <b>Shorty Harris</b>, first appearing as a supporting act in music hall in the 1950s. She underwent gender reassignment surgery on the National Health Service in the early 1960s. This brought her some short-lived notoriety but did not hamper her career. Rogers won acclaim for her appearance in the 1968 review <i>Boys Will be Girls</i> at the Theatre Royal Stratford East and went on to become a highly regarded performer on the UK cabaret circuit. She was the only variety act ever to appear at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. From 1974 onwards she was a regular guest on TV on <i>The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club</i>. She also appeared on BBC TV's long running Music Hall variety show, <i>The Good Old Days</i>. Her cabaret career eventually extended internationally including appearances at Las Vegas and The Magic Castle in Hollywood, and on United States TV.
</p><p>Her work as a magician was always something of a sideline but she was an ingenious developer of magic tricks including illusions for David Copperfield and Paul Daniels.
