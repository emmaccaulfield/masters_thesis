Q101529,Karl M. Baer,"<p>
<b>Karl M. Baer</b> (20 May 1885 – 26 June 1956) was a German-Israeli author, social worker, reformer, suffragist and Zionist. 
</p><p>Born intersex and assigned female at birth, he came out as a trans man in 1904 at the age of 19. In December 1906, he became the first transgender person to undergo sex reassignment surgery, and he became one of the first transgender people to gain full legal recognition of his gender identity by having a male birth certificate issued in January 1907. However, some researchers have disputed his label as a trans man, theorizing that he was intersex, and not transgender.
</p><p>Baer wrote notes for sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld on his experiences growing up female while feeling inside that he was male. Together they developed these notes into the semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical <i>Aus eines Mannes Mädchenjahren</i> (<i>Memoirs of a Man's Maiden Years</i>) (1907) which was published under the pseudonym <b>N.O. Body</b>. The book ""was immensely popular,"" being ""adapted twice to film, in 1912 and 1919."" Baer also gained the right to marry and did so in October 1907.
</p><p>Despite him having undergone gender reaffirming surgery in 1906, exact records of the medical procedures he went through are unknown, as his medical records were burned in the 1930s Nazi book burning, that targeted Hirschfield studies specifically.

<p><b>Keith Farrelle Cozart</b> (born August 15, 1995), better known by his stage name <b>Chief Keef</b>, is an American rapper and record producer. Born and raised in Chicago's South Side, he began his recording career as a teenager and initially garnered regional attention and praise for his mixtapes in the early 2010s. Cozart is often credited with popularizing the hip hop subgenre drill for mainstream audiences, and is considered a progenitor of the genre.
</p><p>His fifth mixtape, <i>Back from the Dead</i> (2012), spawned the single ""I Don't Like"" (featuring Lil Reese), which became a local hit and marked his first entry on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.

Both served as lead singles for his debut studio album, <i>Finally Rich</i> (2012), which was met with moderate critical and commercial response, also serving as his only release on a major label.

</p>

<p><b>Laurence Michael Dillon</b> (1 May 1915 – 15 May 1962) was a British doctor, author, Buddhist monk and the first known transgender man to undergo a phalloplasty. Born in Ladbroke Gardens, Kensington, he and his elder brother moved to Folkestone as children following the death of their mother from sepsis. They were subsequently looked after by their two aunts. Their father, heir to the Dillon baronetcy of Lismullen in Ireland, died in 1925. Although he had been assigned female at birth, Michael Dillon never thought of himself as a girl, and later wrote about his despair at being perceived as such.
</p><p>In 1934, he began studying at the Society of Oxford Home Students at the University of Oxford. He joined the women's rowing team in the position rowing stroke, later being elected club president. He graduated in 1938 and started working in a laboratory near Bristol. Around this time, Dillon became aware of a doctor who had been studying the effects of testosterone on female patients, and started taking the hormone for personal use, driven by a desire to become a man. Dillon left his job at the laboratory after he was outed to his colleagues. He subsequently found a job as a petrol pump attendant in a garage in Bristol and worked there during World War II. Whilst at the garage, he began writing what would become his 1946 book <i>Self: A Study in Ethics and Endocrinology</i>, considered to be a pioneering work in the field of transgender medicine. He also received a gender-affirming double mastectomy whilst in hospital for hypoglycemia and heard of the work of surgeon Sir Harold Gillies, who agreed to perform a phalloplasty on Dillon after the war.
</p><p>In 1945, he enrolled at Trinity College Dublin to study medicine. During the holidays, Dillon travelled to Rooksdown House in Basingstoke to undergo a series of phalloplasty surgeries by Gillies. As a medical student, Dillon performed an orchiectomy on Roberta Cowell, the first British trans woman to receive male-to-female sex reassignment surgery. After graduation, Dillon began working as a Merchant Navy doctor. His transition became the subject of public attention when it affected his listing as the heir presumptive for the baronetcy of Lismullen. Inspired by reading the works of George Gurdjieff, Peter Ouspensky and Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, he resigned from the Merchant Navy and moved to India and to devote his life to Buddhism. He changed his name to <b>Lobzang Jivaka</b>, named after the Buddha's own doctor. In 1960, he became the first Westerner to be ordained in the Rizong Monastery in Ladakh. Between 1960–1962, he wrote four books on Buddhism, including <i>Imji Getsul: An English Buddhist in a Tibetan Monastery</i> which recounted his three months at Rizong. He also wrote an autobiography titled <i>Out of the Ordinary: A Life of Gender and Spiritual Transitions</i>, which was completed in 1962 and published posthumously in 2016. Dillon died in May 1962, just two weeks after finishing his autobiography.

</p><p>Mosier began competing in triathlon in 2009 as female. In 2010, Mosier publicly self-identified as a transgender man in <i>The Advocate</i>, an American LGBTQ+ magazine, after competing in his first race as male. In 2011 Mosier was featured in The New York Times prior to competing in the Nautica New York City Triathlon, a race he competed in two years prior as a woman. In 2016 Mosier was chosen as the first openly transgender athlete to be featured in the ""Body Issue"" of <i>ESPN The Magazine</i>.
</p><p>While he qualified, Mosier was uncertain about his eligibility to compete in the Duathlon World Championship Race in Spain in June 2016 due to the International Olympic Committee policy around the participation of transgender athletes, with specific provisions from the Stockholm Consensus in 2004. In 2015, Mosier challenged the policy, resulting in the creation and adoption of new IOC guidelines for the participation of transgender athletes. Mosier was considered the catalyst for change in the policy in January 2016, after he successfully advocated for change in the policy to allow his participation in the World Championship and future races. Following the policy change, in 2016 Mosier raced in the International Triathlon Union Sprint Duathlon World Championship race in Aviles, Spain, becoming the first known transgender athlete to compete in a World Championship race.

<p><b>Leelah Alcorn</b> (November 15, 1997 – December 28, 2014) was an American transgender girl whose suicide attracted international attention. Prior to her death, she had posted a suicide note to her Tumblr blog about societal standards affecting transgender people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination, abuse, and lack of support for transgender people.
</p><p>Born and raised in Kings Mills, Ohio, Alcorn was assigned male at birth and grew up in a family affiliated with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept the gender that she was assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings.
</p><p>Alcorn used Tumblr's queue feature to publish her suicide note online several hours after her death, and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media. LGBT rights activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems faced by transgender youth, while vigils were held in her memory in the United States and United Kingdom. Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of ""Leelah's Law"", a ban on conversion therapy in the United States, which received a supportive response from then-president Barack Obama. Within a year, the city of Cincinnati criminalized conversion therapy. Alcorn's parents were severely criticized for misgendering and deadnaming her in comments to the media, while LGBT rights activist Dan Savage held them responsible for their child's death, and social media users harassed them online. They defended their refusal to accept Alcorn's identity and their use of conversion therapy by reference to their Christian beliefs.

He has been called the ""Demon of Screamin'"" due to his high screams and his powerful wide vocal range. He is also known for his on-stage acrobatics. During his performances, Tyler usually dresses in colorful, sometimes androgynous outfits and makeup with his trademark scarves hanging from his microphone stand.
</p><p>In the 1970s, Tyler rose to prominence as the lead singer of Aerosmith, which released such hard rock albums as <i>Toys in the Attic</i> and <i>Rocks</i>, along with a string of hit singles, including ""Dream On"", ""Sweet Emotion"" and ""Walk This Way"". By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tyler had a heavy drug and alcohol addiction and the band's popularity waned. In 1986, Tyler completed drug rehabilitation and Aerosmith rose to prominence again when Tyler and Joe Perry joined Run-DMC for a re-make of ""Walk This Way"", which became a Top 5 hit. Aerosmith subsequently launched a comeback with the multi-platinum albums <i>Permanent Vacation</i>, <i>Pump</i>, <i>Get a Grip</i> and <i>Nine Lives</i>, which produced a combined thirteen Top 40 singles and won the band numerous awards. During this time, the band embarked on their longest concert tours, promoted their singles with conceptual music videos, and made appearances in television, film and video games.
</p><p>Since the late 1980s, Tyler has embarked on several solo endeavors, including guest appearances with musicians including Alice Cooper, Mötley Crüe, Santana, Pink and Keith Anderson, film and TV work, authoring a book, and solo music, including the Top 40 single ""(It) Feels So Good"" in 2011. Tension with his Aerosmith bandmates arose in 2009 and 2010 after he fell off the stage at a concert, and had a relapse with prescription drugs, receiving treatment in 2009. He also signed on to <i>American Idol</i> without telling the other members of the band. Nonetheless, Tyler has continued to record music and perform with Aerosmith, after more than 50 years as a member of the group. In 2016, he released his debut solo album, <i>We're All Somebody from Somewhere</i>, a country rock album that included the single ""Love Is Your Name"". Tyler supported the album with the ""Out on a Limb"" tour. Tyler continues to perform both solo, with backing from the Loving Mary Band, and with Aerosmith.

She was imprisoned from 2010 until 2017 when her sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama. A trans woman, Manning said in 2013 that she had a female gender identity since childhood and wanted to be known as Chelsea Manning.
</p><p>Assigned in 2009 to an Army unit in Iraq as an intelligence analyst, Manning had access to classified databases. In early 2010, she leaked classified information to WikiLeaks and confided this to Adrian Lamo, an online acquaintance. Lamo indirectly informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command, and Manning was arrested in May 2010. The material included videos of the July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike and the 2009 Granai airstrike in Afghanistan; 251,287 U.S. diplomatic cables; and 482,832 Army reports that came to be known as the ""Iraq War Logs"" and ""Afghan War Diary"". The material was published by WikiLeaks and its media partners between April 2010 and April 2011.
</p><p>Manning was charged with 22 offenses, including aiding the enemy, which was the most serious charge and could have resulted in a death sentence. She was held at the Marine Corps Brig, Quantico in Virginia, from July 2010 to April 2011, under Prevention of Injury status—which entailed <i>de facto</i> solitary confinement and other restrictions that caused domestic and international concern—before being transferred to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she could interact with other detainees. In February 2013 she pleaded guilty to 10 of the charges. The trial on the remaining charges began on June 3, 2013, and on July 30, she was convicted of 17 of the original charges and amended versions of four others, but acquitted of aiding the enemy. She was sentenced to 35 years at the maximum-security U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth. On January 17, 2017, Obama commuted Manning's sentence to nearly seven years of confinement dating from her arrest in May 2010. After release, Manning makes her living through speaking engagements.

<p><b>Sir Ewan Forbes, 11th Baronet</b>,  (6 September 1912 – 12 September 1991), was a Scottish nobleman, general practitioner and farmer. Forbes was a trans man; he was officially registered as the youngest daughter of John, Lord Sempill. After an uncomfortable upbringing, he began presenting as a man in the 1930s, following a course of medical treatments in Germany. He formally re-registered his birth as male in 1952, changing his name to Ewan, and was married a month later.
</p><p>In 1965, he stood to inherit the baronetcy of his elder brother William, Lord Sempill, together with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit the baronetcy. The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session, which held him to be intersex, finally led to the Home Secretary recognising his claim to the title. The case was heard in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable to be considered in other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.

Q484609,Analatos Painter,"<p>The <b>Analatos Painter</b> was an Attic vase painter of the Early Proto-Attic style.
</p><p>The name of the Analatos Painter is derived from the central Attic area of Analatos (today  Nea Smyrni), where several of his works have been excavated. His name vase is a <i>hydria</i>. His period of activity is estimated to be similar to that of the Mesogeia Painter, between c. 700 and 675 BC. It is possible that the Analatos Painter was also a potter.
</p><p>The Analatos Painter belongs to the transition from Late Geometric to Early Proto-Attic vase painting. He is thought to have been a pupil of the Late Geometric Statathou Painter. The earliest works ascribed to him are still within a clear Late Geometric tradition. For example, one of his Geometric <i>hydriai</i> depicts a <i>prothesis</i> (laying-out of a body), showing Egyptian influences. The adoption of eastern influences was a key feature of the subsequent Orientalising Period, of which the Analatos Painter was one of the main early proponents. Characteristic of this new style were fantastic animals, sphinxes without wings or faces, rows of dancing men or women, cable patterns and rosettes. His oldest known amphora, now in the Ashmolean Museum shows a row of two-horsed chariots on its belly, as does a <i>loutrophoros</i> in the Louvre and several other pieces. In the execution of detail, he frequently followed older precepts.
</p><p>Besides amphorae and <i>hydria</i>i, he also painted kraters, bowls and lids. A votive plaque attributed to him bears the inscription ΣΟΝΟΣΈΠΙΣΤ (<i>(...)SONOS EPIST(AMENOS): ""under the direction of ...son (Name)""</i>), indicating that he was literate; it is the oldest known painted inscription in Greek.

Yearwood began competing on a high school girls' team in early April 2017 and won first place in the girls 100- and 200-meter dashes. Yearwood's second-place finish at the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (CIAC) 100-yard dash finals on June 4, 2017, behind another transgender student, gained international media attention.
</p><p>The decision of the State of Connecticut to allow Yearwood to compete on the women's team is a focus of debate surrounding Title IX and trans people. In 2018, writing on the subject of transgender people in sports, ESPN called Yearwood and a handful of other transgender athletes ""focal points in a fight over the future of sports"". Yearwood has competed without hormones or puberty blockers, which, according to Vice Media, ""could have contributed to an advantage"". However, Vice Media also stated that schools requiring medical treatment for transgender athletes would create a barrier to entry due to the costs of treatment. In June 2018, in the state of Connecticut, there was a petition created by parents of student-athletes that had the goal of banning transgender girls from competing in girls' sports. This petition allowed Yearwood to speak on <i>Good Morning America</i> and address the issues that came with the petition and encourage other transgender girls to compete. The families of three students who have competed against Yearwood filed a lawsuit in an attempt to bar transgender athletes from competing in women's teams in Connecticut; the families are represented by the conservative nonprofit organization, Alliance Defending Freedom. The lawsuit was dismissed in April 2021 by the district court as moot.
</p><p>In 2019, Andraya Yearwood appeared in <i>Changing The Game</i>, a documentary that highlights the stories of three transgender athletes and the hardships they faced in the athletic industry being a transgender person.

</p>

<p><b>Genesis Breyer P-Orridge</b> (born <b>Neil Andrew Megson</b>; 22 February 1950 – 14 March 2020) was an English singer-songwriter, musician, poet, performance artist, visual artist,  and occultist who rose to notoriety as the founder of the COUM Transmissions artistic collective and lead vocalist of seminal industrial band Throbbing Gristle. They were also a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental pop rock band Psychic TV.
</p><p>Born in Manchester, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, they moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted <i>Genesis P-Orridge</i> as their pseudonym. On returning to Hull, they founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 <i>Prostitution</i> show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the ""wreckers of civilisation."" P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house.
</p><p>In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. As a result of the incident, P-Orridge left the United Kingdom for the United States and settled in New York City. There, they married Jacqueline Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a ""pandrogyne"", or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, they retired from music to focus on other artistic media in 2009.
</p><p>P-Orridge was credited on over 200 releases during their lifetime. They were cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a cult following, and had been given the moniker of the ""Godparent of Industrial Music"". P-Orridge considered themself third-gender and used various gender-neutral pronouns.

She underwent gender reassignment surgery on the National Health Service in the early 1960s. This brought her some short-lived notoriety but did not hamper her career.

</p><p>In traditional Zuni culture, the <i>lhamana</i> are male-bodied people who take on the social and ceremonial roles usually performed by women in their culture, at least some of the time.

""He was the most intelligent person in the pueblo. Strong character made his word law among both men and women with whom he associated.
